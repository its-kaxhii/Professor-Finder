# China University Professor Research Agent ("Professor Finder")

Discover professors at Chinese universities by research field. Find official faculty profiles, verify publicly listed
institutional emails, and filter or export results. Emails are never guessed.

Provide an official university website and your research fields. The app then:

1. identifies the university (English and Chinese name, location),
2. finds the **schools and departments that match your fields** (e.g. 计算机学院 for Computer Science / AI),
3. walks their official faculty directories and lists **every professor** with:
   - name (English + Chinese), position and department
   - their **publicly listed institutional email**
   - their **official profile link**
   - a **verification status** and the source pages

You can then search and filter the list, copy all the emails, export the results to CSV, Excel or PDF, and write an
editable supervision-request email.

> **Core principle: no guessing.** Every email must literally appear on the professor's official page; it is never
> built from a naming pattern. An optional LLM only reads pages that were actually fetched, and anything it returns
> is re-checked against the page text. If an email isn't published, the app shows **"Not publicly listed"**.

| Decision | Why |
|---|---|
| **Background jobs** (`POST /start` → `job_id`, then poll) | A crawl takes 1–3 minutes. Jobs run on a bounded thread pool and write progress to the database, so the page can show live progress. |
| **Async `httpx` + BeautifulSoup**, **Playwright** as fallback | Fast, polite fetching with per-host rate limits. Playwright renders pages whose faculty lists or emails are filled in by JavaScript, which is common on Chinese faculty systems. |
| **Heuristics first, LLM optional** | Deterministic parsers (Chinese name detection, email regex including `name#domain` forms, bilingual department matching) do the work. An LLM only helps pick links or read awkward pages, and is grounding-checked. |
| **Same-origin `/api`** | The frontend contains no backend URL and no secrets. |

## Workflow

```
Enter URL + fields ─▶ University ─▶ Relevant departments ─▶ Faculty directories ─▶ Profiles ─▶ Verify ─▶ List
```

1. **University:** fetches the homepage (and the English site if linked) and reads the official name and address.
2. **Departments:** opens the schools index (院系设置 / 学院部门 / Schools) and scores each school against your fields in English and Chinese (`计算机`, `软件`, `人工智能`, …). It prefers department homepages on their own subdomain and ignores news links, off-site redirects and non-academic units.
3. **Professors:** follows each department's faculty directory (师资队伍 / 教师名录 / Faculty), including pagination and 教授/副教授 tabs, then opens each profile. It reads the name, position and email:
   - Emails written as `name#domain`, `name [at] domain` or `mailto:` links are recognised.
   - Office and footer emails (e.g. `cs@…`) are excluded.
   - When a profile has an email field but the address is filled in by JavaScript, the page is rendered in a browser (Playwright) and read again.
4. **Verification:** re-checks every email against the page text, removes duplicates (the same professor on Chinese and English pages), and lists verified contacts first.

**Chinese names:** names are romanised with pinyin ("张伟" → "Zhang Wei"). Characters with genuinely ambiguous readings (e.g. 曾 Zeng/Ceng) keep the Chinese name only, and English names written on the page always win.

## Quick start (local)

Prerequisites: Python 3.12+, Node.js 22+ (or 24.15+).

```bash
# 1. Backend
cd backend
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate            # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
pip install playwright && playwright install chromium   # recommended (JavaScript-rendered emails)
cp ../.env.example .env              # set PLAYWRIGHT_ENABLED=true; OPENAI_API_KEY optional
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000               # API docs: http://localhost:8000/docs

# Optional: offline demo data (runs the real workflow against the bundled mock university)
python -m scripts.seed_demo

# 2. Frontend (new terminal)
cd frontend
npm install
npm start                            # http://localhost:4200  (proxies /api → :8000)
```

**Everything in Docker** (PostgreSQL + backend with Playwright + nginx frontend):

```bash
cp .env.example .env
docker compose up --build            # http://localhost:8080
```

## Environment variables

All secrets stay server-side. See [`.env.example`](.env.example) for every option.

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `DATABASE_URL` | `sqlite:///./research_agent.db` | PostgreSQL in production (`postgres://` URLs accepted) |
| `AUTO_CREATE_TABLES` | `true` | Set `false` when using Alembic (Docker does) |
| `PLAYWRIGHT_ENABLED` | `false` | **Recommended `true`.** Renders JavaScript faculty lists and emails |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` / `OPENAI_BASE_URL` / `LLM_MODEL` | — / — / `gpt-4.1-mini` | Optional AI help for unusual page layouts |
| `MAX_PROFESSORS` / `MAX_DEPARTMENTS` | `150` / `5` | Limits per job (up to 150 professors; actual results depend on published faculty directories) |
| `ALLOW_NON_INSTITUTIONAL_EMAILS` | `false` | Also show personal emails (e.g. `@163.com`, `@sina.com`) listed on official profiles |
| `MAX_PAGES_PER_JOB` | `200` | Crawl budget per job |
| `REQUEST_DELAY_SECONDS` | `1.0` | Per-host politeness delay |
| `RESPECT_ROBOTS_TXT` | `true` | Obey robots.txt |
| `CACHE_TTL_HOURS` | `72` | Page cache lifetime (users can force a fresh crawl) |
| `SEARCH_PROVIDER` / `SEARCH_API_KEY` | `none` | Optional fallback for finding departments: `serper`, `brave`, `tavily`, `searxng` |
| `DEFAULT_FIELDS` | 14 CS fields | Comma-separated default research fields |
| `CORS_ORIGINS` | `http://localhost:4200` | Allowed frontend origins |
| `APP_ACCESS_TOKEN` | — | Optional shared token required on `/api/*` (entered under Settings) |
| `MAX_JOBS_PER_HOUR_PER_IP` / `MAX_CONCURRENT_JOBS` | `20` / `2` | Abuse protection / parallel jobs |

## Database

Tables: `universities`, `research_jobs`, `departments`, `professors`, `sources`, `research_results`, `page_cache`,
`email_drafts`. Each job is a snapshot. `sources` records every page a record came from (URL, type, title,
retrieval time). `page_cache` avoids re-crawling the same pages.

```bash
cd backend
alembic upgrade head                           # create/upgrade schema (PostgreSQL)
alembic revision --autogenerate -m "change"    # after editing app/models.py
```

## Running tests

```bash
cd backend && pytest -q                       # 72 tests, fully offline
cd frontend && npx ng test --watch=false      # 9 tests (Vitest)
```

The backend suite runs the **whole workflow against a mock Chinese university** (`backend/tests/mock_site.py`). The
mock site deliberately includes GBK-encoded pages, `name#domain` and `[at]` emails, footer office emails,
paginated directories, a duplicate English profile, a broken profile link, a gmail-only professor, an ambiguous
name romanisation and a robots.txt-blocked path. The tests check that:

- emails are never invented, including a fake LLM that returns fabricated ones
- emails rendered by JavaScript are found
- duplicates are merged
- unneeded pages are never crawled
- exports, every API endpoint, access-token auth and rate limiting work

## Deployment

**Render (backend + PostgreSQL):** push to GitHub → Render → *New Blueprint* → pick the repo
([`render.yaml`](render.yaml)). Set `CORS_ORIGINS` to your frontend URL. To enable JavaScript rendering, add
`INSTALL_PLAYWRIGHT=true` (used as a Docker build arg) and set `PLAYWRIGHT_ENABLED=true`.

**Vercel (frontend):** import the repo with root directory `frontend`. In [`frontend/vercel.json`](frontend/vercel.json)
replace `YOUR-BACKEND.onrender.com` with your backend host.

**Single VPS:** `docker compose up -d --build` and put a TLS proxy (Caddy/Traefik) in front.

## Verification rules

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **VERIFIED** | Name found on the professor's official profile page, the page is on the university's domain, and the email is literally present on it |
| **PARTIALLY VERIFIED** | Official profile found, but no institutional email is published on it |
| **NOT VERIFIED** | The profile page could not be loaded, or isn't on the official domain |

## Limitations & responsible use

- Some Chinese university sites protect pages with **anti-bot checks that reject automated browsers**. The app never tries to evade them; it lists those pages by name so you can open them yourself.
- Emails shown only as images can't be read and are reported as "Not publicly listed".
- Without an OpenAI key, the app relies on heuristics, which work well on conventional faculty directories.
- Crawling is deliberately polite: it follows robots.txt, adds per-host delays, has a page budget and caches pages. Please keep it that way.
- Always open a professor's profile before writing to them. Email drafts are never sent automatically.
